**Before sending this issue:**
- Take a couple seconds and search to see if there is already an issue (open or closed) for the problem you're having.
- If Project: Title suddenly stopped working, did you just upgrade KOReader? Project: Title versions are locked to specific releases of KOReader. Your options are to downgrade or wait. I try my best to get new versions of the plugin out quickly when KOReader updates but there is always a delay.
